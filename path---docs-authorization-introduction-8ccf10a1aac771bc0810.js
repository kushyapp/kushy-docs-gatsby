OAuth is an authorization framework that enables a third-party application to obtain access to protected resources (e.g. Admin or Business level access) in the Kushy API. Access to the Kushy API can be granted to an application either on behalf of a user or on behalf of the application itself. This section covers application auth which is meant for server-to-server applications using the Kushy API.</p>\n<h2>Creating an application</h2>\n<p>Before you can get started with making OAuth requests, youâ€™ll need to first register an application with Kushy by logging in and navigating to <a href="https://kushy.net/developers/apps">the applications page</a>. Once an application is registered you will obtain your <code class="language-text">client_id</code>, <code class="language-text">callback_url</code>, and <code class="language-text">client_secret</code> (aka App Key and Secret), which will be used to identify your application when calling the Kushy API. Learn more in our getting started guide. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember: Your <code class="language-text">client_secret</code> should be kept a secret! Be sure to store your client credentials securely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Token lifetime</h2>\n<p>Access tokens are short lived: 1 hour. To refresh authorization on an application access token, your application will simply exchange its client credentials for a new app access token which will invalidate the previous token.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Authorization",route:"/authorization/"},fields:{slug:"/docs/authorization/introduction/",section:"docs",category:"authorization"}},sidebar:{totalCount:16,edges:[{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Delete strain",method:"delete",route:"/strains/:id"},fields:{slug:"/docs/strains/delete-strain/",category:"strains"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Get all strains",method:"get",route:"/strains/"},fields:{slug:"/docs/strains/get-all-strains/",category:"strains"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Get specific strain",method:"get",route:"/strains/:id"},fields:{slug:"/docs/strains/get-specific-strain/",category:"strains"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Get all states",method:"get",route:"/states/"},fields:{slug:"/docs/states/get-all-states/",category:"states"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Get specific states",method:"get",route:"/states/:state"},fields:{slug:"/docs/states/get-specific-state/",category:"states"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Delete shop",method:"delete",route:"/shops/:id"},fields:{slug:"/docs/shops/delete-shop/",category:"shops"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Get all shops",method:"get",route:"/shops/"},fields:{slug:"/docs/shops/get-all-shops/",category:"shops"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Get specific shop",method:"get",route:"/shops/:id"},fields:{slug:"/docs/shops/get-specific-shop/",category:"shops"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Create new shop",method:"post",route:"/shops/"},fields:{slug:"/docs/shops/post-create-shop/",category:"shops"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Update shop",method:"put",route:"/shops/:id"},fields:{slug:"/docs/shops/put-update-shop/",category:"shops"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Get search results from all posts",method:"get",route:"/search/:field/:search"},fields:{slug:"/docs/search/get-search-all-posts/",category:"search"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Get all inventory",method:"get",route:"/inventory/"},fields:{slug:"/docs/inventory/get-all-inventory/",category:"inventory"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Get inventory of specific shop/brand",method:"get",route:"/inventory/menu/:slug"},fields:{slug:"/docs/inventory/get-menu-inventory/",category:"inventory"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Authorization",method:null,route:"/authorization/application"},fields:{slug:"/docs/authorization/application-authorization/",category:"authorization"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Authorization",method:null,route:"/authorization/"},fields:{slug:"/docs/authorization/introduction/",category:"authorization"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Scopes",method:null,route:"/authorization/scopes"},fields:{slug:"/docs/authorization/scopes/",category:"authorization"}}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"/docs/authorization/introduction/",category:"authorization"}}}});
